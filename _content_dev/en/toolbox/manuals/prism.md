## Travel, manipulation, cleaning

For every travel of the **Prism**, take it back in the wooden flightcase, packed up as at the receipt.  

Never raise the **Prism** by the upside slab, by taking the screen, at the risk of breaking it. Carry it with the downside slab includes no risk.

Before cleaning the **Prism**, turn it off for avoiding electric choc. For the glass pyramid, use a classical windshield washer and a microfiber towel for not scratching. With this equipment, tou can also wash the entire structure.

Do not leave the **Prism** in a wet environment, at a temperature below 0°C or under 45°C. Do not put in contact of water.
