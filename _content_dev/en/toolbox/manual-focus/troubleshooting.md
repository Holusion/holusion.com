## Identification

### Identify a product

The *Focus* have a written serial number on the front of the IT case.

For the products that have WIFI transmitter, the network SSID will be in the form :

<code>focus-XX</code>

XX being the serial number of the product.

The serial number is also written on the product's purchase/rent bill.

## Turning ON

### The product doesn't turn ON
That can be due to many causes :

- The product is not correctly electrically supplied
  - The ventilators do not run
  - The "Power" diode of the computer is not ON (if present)
- [Screens are OFF](#un-des-crans-est-teint)
  - The control panel's diode has to be lighted in green or orange.
- [Screens are improperly configured](#un-cran-nest-pas-en-mode-dvi)
  - When the screens are connected to the server, they must briefly light up, display a blue screen and "DVI" in the corner.

### One of the screens is OFF

Make sure that the screen is properly supplied, that the DVI cable is plugged.

- The screens have a control panel. The diode must be lighted in green or orange.
- When the screens are connected to the server, they must briefly light up, display a blue screen and "DVI" in the corner.

### One of the screens is not in "DVI" mode

By using the control pannel of the involved screen :

- press <span class="icon" style="background:url('/static/img/posts/manuel-focus/screen_control/menu.svg') center / cover"></span>
- select the second tab with <span class="icon" style="background:url('/static/img/posts/manuel-focus/screen_control/next.svg') center / cover"></span> and <span class="icon" style="background:url('/static/img/posts/manuel-focus/screen_control/menu.svg') center / cover"></span>. Then select `DVI`.
- Press <span class="icon" style="background:url('/static/img/posts/manuel-focus/screen_control/menu.svg') center / cover"></span> again to confirm.

### The image is scrambled or noisy

Often characterized with green lines on the image.

The problem is coming from **DVI-D** cables that connect the screen to the Focus' computer.

- Disassemble the pyramid (see the teardown procedure)(link)
- Take off the opaque plates
- If the cables were not properly plugged : plug it back without forgetting the safety screws
- If the cables were well plugged : replace the cable.
