abstract: Horizontal holographic showcase to use with tablets
description: |
    Placed horizontally above a tilted piece of glass, your tablet becomes a real 3D hologram displayer. The back of the Opal is opaque in order to obtain very contrasted and bright pictures. Have fun by placing objects behind the glass surface to create your own world with holograms.
