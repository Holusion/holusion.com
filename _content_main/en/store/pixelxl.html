description: |
    The Pixel XL is specially made for tablets. It displays 3D holograms in 360 degrees on each face of the pyramid. Bigger than the Pixel, it fits the 10" to 13" screens.
    The Pixel XL is fixed by a suction cup on the tablet. Your tablet and its hologram can then be easily used in many situations and will always be by your side.
