    <h2>A new way to discover exhibitions</h2>
    <div class="content m-auto">
      <p>
        Museums always search for new ways to reinvent themselves and present their exhibitions. This desir to present something new often brings them to search for innovative solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many museums have already decided to use holograms to present their exhibitions. Be it to present the works or to create interesting presentations, holograms allow the dynamization of cultural locale.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The exhibition “Discover with Renoir” is a good example of that, with the help of a <b> <a href="https://holusion.com/en/products/iris75">personalized Iris 75</a>, a good scenography and an effective casting</b>, the hologram offers a surprising way to discover the works of Renoir.

      <p>
        Sometimes some works are too brittle to be shown to the public or the museum doesn't have access to it anymore. In those cases, a combination of <b>numerisation and a hologram</b> can allow the public to still discover those works.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hologram can even be used in the case of <b>mapping</b>, to project information on a work without damaging them. This can immerse the spectator in the universe of the work and plunge them into what they are watching.

      </p>
      <p> 
        The holographic solution can be a good way to show visitors the path that a place took with the passage of time. <b>The castle of Alençon</b> is a good example of that, indeed the hologram outside of the castle shows the castle throughout the ages and thus allow to discover its history.

        <h2>Interaction with the works</h2>
        <div class="content m-auto">
          <p>
            To add <b>dynamism</b> to cultural works, interactivity is often a good solution. The visitors are much often impacted by the work if they had an interaction with it. One of the objectives of the hologram is to be able to bring that too.
          </p>
        <p>
          It’s in this context that we can make <a href="https://holusion.com/en/interaction/">custom applications</a> that, with the use of a tablet, can allow visitors to fully connect with a work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The interactive options</b> allow to discover a work in all its facets, we can indeed zoom in on details, add complementary information or even show the “invisible” parts of an object, like for example the inside of a statue.
