      <h2>Holograms today and tomorrow</h2>
      <p>
        Holograms have arrived as a disruptive technology that has turned many industries upside down, such as <a href="/en/posts/2020-07-21-Article_Alencon">culture</a>, <a href="/en/posts/2021-02-17-Mokka">technical innovation</a> or <a href="/en/posts/2021-02-18-PierreDeSeine">real estate</a>. The need to innovate and stay on top of current trends is very important for any company in the 21st century.

    <h2>The future of holograms</h2>

      <p>
        But, where will holograms take us next? What new uses could we have for them? By using the Pepper’s Ghost technology used by Holusion, the possibilities are pretty much endless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we have a few uses of holographic technology that will come in very handy in the future.

    <h2>Military uses</h2>
    <div class="content m-auto">
      <p>
        If you have seen the movie <i>The Hunger Games</i>, you may remember the scene where Katniss impresses everyone with her skills by training with holograms. This could be a very useful way for soldiers to train in real life situations in a controlled environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another military use which is not in place today, but which could significantly improve in the future is Military Mapping. Every detail counts when soldiers are training for a mission, and holographic technology is a big help. Allowing soldiers to view every terrain in detail helps them prepare in the best way possible.

    <h2>Medical uses</h2>
    <div class="content m-auto">
      <p>
        Being a Doctor is a big responsibility, so every piece of technology that helps the medical field to save lives is a big plus. 3D imagery in a holographic form is a great way to visualize a patient’s body with high resolution in order to plan the clinical procedure to be set in place.

      --img alt="Example for hologram's medical uses"
    %}    
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The possibility to even isolate an organ or a body part in a hologram to be able to interact with it and see the potential outcome of a procedure could mean a significant improvement in the efficiency of doctors and surgeons thus improving health care across the globe.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Another use for holographic technology in the medical field would be to train medical students. In addition to using bodies donated for science, medical students could use holograms to learn about human bodies or different existing surgeries and even practice with a hologram.

    <h2>Tourism and Hospitality</h2>

      <p>
        Welcoming guests to a hotel, providing a guided tour in a museum or even taking your order in a restaurant. These applications may seem taken out of a sci-fi movie, but we are much closer to it than what we might think. Today for instance, we can visit <a href="/en/posts/2020-06-15-Article_Renoir">Auguste Renoir</a> at the Museum Fournaise at Chatou in France where he can be your guide in a journey across the Impressionist Island on the Seine River near Paris.

      <h2>Space research</h2>
      <p>
        Research and experimentation is crucial to know more about our world and the universe. Holographic technology could be an ideal way to carry out experiments, for example, a scientist that would view something that he has put under a microscope and magnify it to have a different perspective and level. Another use could be to explore space. If we already have some mapping done thanks to our satellites in space, we could eventually use holograms to embarc on our own personal space adventure.

      <h2>What's next ?</h2>
      <p>
        Possibilities are endless. Across History, we have developed products and technology that could have seemed completely crazy and near impossible to bring to life 100 years ago. However, thanks to R&D, we have near limitless possibilities to create and innovate products and technology to improve the quality of life and work of all of us. What’s left for us to do is to keep imagining, to keep innovating and to keep dreaming of what tomorrow will bring… Who knows, maybe a real life Star Trek mission will be set in place sooner than we think.
