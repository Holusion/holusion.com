    <p>
        <i> The museum contacted us in 2019 to create an holographic projection in order to welcome the public in the museum. Indeed, a great opportunity arose by that time, as Hugo Lloris, the famous french football player and newly world champion, was available for an interview. </i>
      </p>

      <h2> Steps :</h2>
      <p>
        The interview was conducted within the museum, where a crew filmed the player in front of a black screen while answering questions asked by Vincent Dubuc, a journalist for the french newspaper "L'Equipe".

        The, we crafted a custom-made Iris 85 to display a life-size Hugo Lloris hologram to welcome the visitors. Located in the entrance hall, <b> the hologram measures 1,85m, which is the exact same size of the football goalkeeper. </b> The public can choose its own language to listen to the welcoming speech : "Hello, I am Hugo Lloris [...] welcome the the National Sports museum."
      </p>

        <p>
          Another holographic projection was displayed in a neighbouring room : it was an hologram that answered the question of the audience. Among <b> a sample of about thirty questions </b>, the visitor can for instance choose to ask Hugo Lloris what are his rituals before the match or what a day in his life looks like. Holusion did not originally created the device, but we developped an application and modified the original videos to have a smooth depiction.
