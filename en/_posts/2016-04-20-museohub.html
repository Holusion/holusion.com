It has indeed many factories. This year, the <a href="http://www.museomix.org/editions/2015/roubaix/prototypes/ca-tisse-factory-a-roubaix" target="_blank">Tisse-Factory</a> project, wich is born on the <a href="http://www.museomix.org/" target="_blank">Museomix</a> 2015, has the ambition to connect <a href="http://www.lamanufacture-roubaix.fr/" target="_blank">Manufacture</a> with all the production centers. Here is an innovative presentation of this journey, revealed in the Palais des Beaux-Arts on the 4th edition of the <a href="https://museohub.hypotheses.org/category/museohub-4-2016" target="_blank">MuseoHub</a> the 19th and 20th of april 2016 !</p>

    <h3>One more step on the road of museum digitalization</h3>

    <p class="rtejustify">This year, the goal of <a href="https://museohub.hypotheses.org/category/museohub-4-2016" target="_blank">Mus√©oHub</a> is to bring the museum's world, the research's world, the technologic world and the cultural mediation's world all together. This fourth edition was relying on a scientif day about the Plans-Reliefs (see picture) presenting 15 great models of North France and Europe towns at the Palais de Beaux-Arts of Lille. University actors, museums and companies are working together on these physical or virtual models to present them in a new way. The use of models causes questions about their validation, reconstruction's fiablity, and the loyalty to the past.</p>

    <p class="rtejustify">A good day to learn or share informations and experiences about finished or not projects... Discover all the actors of this day in this <a href="https://live3.univ-lille3.fr/video-recherche/ouverture-de-la-journee-museohub4.html" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
