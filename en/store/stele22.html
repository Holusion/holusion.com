  <h2> Why do you need to place your Iris 22 that high ? </h2>  
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      To have the better holographic experience, you need the eye of the observer to be right under the horizontal line formed by the screen, as it is depicted on this drawing.
    </p>
    {% picture grid img/accessories/sketch_hauteur-ecran.png 
      alt="sketch de la position de l'oeil par rapport à un écran d'Iris 22"
      class="img-fluid"
    %}
    <p>
      Doing so, the observer can’t see the screen and the point of view is perfect to look at the hologram in optimal conditions. If you add an <a href="/en/store/fond22">opaque background</a>, the experience will be even more immersive and fascinating for the public.
