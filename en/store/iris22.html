    <h2 class="pt-4">Features of the IRIS 22</h2>
    <h3>Dimensions and transport</h3>
    <p> 
      The Iris 22 is <b>55cm by 40cm by 35cm</b> and we can find a <b>22 inches</b> wide HD screen in its upper side. This screen enables the display of a <b>49cm by 27cm</b> picture which is visible over 180°. The holographic showcase is quite small and you can set it up almost everywhere.
      The Iris 22 <b>only weighs 8kg</b> so it can be easily transported in its <a href="/en/store/flight22">tailor-made flight case</a>, which is perfect if you have to move to another point of sale.

    <h3>Pepper’s ghost illusion</h3>
    <p>
      The hologram exists because of <b> the Pepper's ghost optical illusion</b>. There is a HD screen with high brightness (1600cd/m²) at the top of the Iris 22, it projects a picture downward, on an angled glass pane and it creates the illusion of a <b>3D picture that levitates </b>thanks to the optical illusion.

  <h2>Functioning of the IRIS 22</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The holographic showcase works thanks to a minicomputer which allows you to manage your content remotely thanks to your smartphone, tablet or computer with the <a href="/en/interaction/">Holusion Companion</a> app.
      You can also connect your Iris 22 to a <a href="/en/store/router">mini WIFI router </a>  thanks to an Ethernet cable. Doing so, you will be able to easily change the content of the Iris 22, online, as much as you want and in a few seconds only.

    </p>
    <p>
      Each Iris 22 can store <b>hundreds of 3D models</b> and you can display your own creations ! Hence, you can present your products and information about them, in a fascinating 3D display. Thereby, you will have an <b>innovative and interactive medium</b> to strengthen your speeches and enthral your audience. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you can program the Iris 22 by yourself thanks to the <b>available API</b>. There are <b>four USB ports</b> on the holographic showcase so that you can plug various sensors (touch-sensitive screen, NFC sensor…) to enhance the experience even more.
