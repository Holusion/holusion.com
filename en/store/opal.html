    <h2>Composition and functioning</h2>
    <p>
      This small holographic showcase is made of a black metallic structure and of an angled glass pane. The top of the structure is opened so that you can place your tablet protected by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Security_Slot">antitheft</a> device in it.
    </p>
    <p> 
      You can discover a hologram playlist specially designed for you on  <a href="https://pixel.holusion.com">pixel.holusion.com</a>. Everything goes through your internet browser so the Opal is compatible with both iOS and Android devices, and you don’t need to install any app.

    <h3>Pepper's ghost illusion</h3>
    <p>
      The hologram exists because of <b>the Pepper's ghost optical illusion</b>. Your tablet, at the top of the structure projects an animated picture downward, directly on the angled glass pane. It creates the illusion of a <b>3D picture that levitates</b>, thanks to the optical illusion.

    <h3>Create your own hologram playlist</h3>
    <p>
      By signing in to <a href="https://pixel.holusion.com">pixel.holusion.com</a>, you can <b>create your own hologram playlist</b> with original designs that you can realise with your own images, videos or 3D animations. If you place something behind the glass pane, you can realise a <b>video mapping</b>. Thanks to this, you can create special effects around your objects, like figurines for instance. Thereby, you create a story around them or you only provide the public with key information (price, origin, history, explanations…)

  <h2>Two designs, two experiences</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The Opal is available in both <b>horizontal and vertical versions</b> (Opal H and Opal V). Hence, you can choose the design that suits your setup the best. Both designs weigh only 3kg so you can transport it very easily which is ideal if you have to move to other points of sale or other exhibitions.
