    <h2>Features of the Prism</h2>
    <p>
      The illusion of the floating picture inside of the glass pyramid will <b>draw your customer’s attention</b> so that you can start a conversation about the product displayed in the Prism. You can customise the content and create a 3D picture that perfectly suits you. The hologram is visible over 360° so you can place the Prism in the middle of a room and let people see the hologram from each side of the Prism.

    <h3>Pepper's ghost illusion</h3>
    <p>
      The hologram exists because of <b>the Pepper's ghost optical illusion </b>. There is a HD screen with high brightness on the top of the Prism, it projects four pictures that are identical but independent downward, one on each face of the pyramid. It creates the illusion of a <b>3D picture that levitates</b> in the pyramid, thanks to the optical illusion.
