    <h3>Dimensions and transport</h3>
    <p> 
      The Iris 32 is <b>82cm by 68cm by 51cm</b> and we can find a <b>32 inches</b> wide HD screen in its upper side. This screen enables the display of a <b>70cm by 39cm</b> picture which is visible over 180°. This holographic showcase is quite small and you can set it up almost everywhere. 
      The Iris 32 can be easily transported in its <a href="/en/store/flight32">tailor-made flight case </a>, which is perfect if you have to move to another point of sale.

    <h3>Pepper's ghost illusion</h3>
    <p>
      The hologram exists because of <b>the Pepper's ghost optical illusion</b>. There is a HD screen with high brightness (1000cd/m²) at the top of the Iris 32, it projects a picture downward, on an angled glass pane and it creates the illusion of a <b>3D picture that levitates</b> thanks to the optical illusion.

  <h2>Functioning of the Iris 32</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The holographic showcase works thanks to a minicomputer which allows you to manage your content remotely thanks to your smartphone, tablet or computer with the <a href="/en/interaction/">Holusion Companion</a> app.
      You can also connect your Iris 32 to a  <a href="/en/store/router">mini WIFI router</a> thanks to an Ethernet cable.
      Doing so, you will be able to easily change the content of the Iris 32, online, as much as you want and in a few seconds only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Iris 32 can store <b>hundreds of 3D models</b> and you can display your own creations ! Hence, you can present your products and information about them, in a fascinating 3D display. Thereby, you will have an <b>innovative and interactive medium</b> to strengthen your speeches and enthral your audience.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Finally, you can program the Iris 32 by yourself thanks to the <b>available API</b>. There are <b>four USB ports</b> on the holographic showcase so that you can plug various sensors (touch-sensitive screen, NFC sensor…) to enhance the experience even more.
