    <h3>Tailor-made</h3>
    <p>
      This flight case is made of black <b>alveolar plastic</b>, strengthened by <b>steel corner pieces</b> for higher protection. The case can be opened and closed with <b>butterfly clasps</b> that prevent it from accidental openings. The flight case is quite small and can be placed in most car trunks.

    <h3> Transport suggestions </h3>
    <p>
      When you put your Iris 22 in its flight case, <b>take care about the mobile elements</b> such as the power cable but <b>especially the glass pane</b>. You can place cardboard pieces between the pane and the metallic structure in order to prevent the pane from moving during the transport. Two handles are placed on each side of the case so it <b>can be carried by two people.</b>
