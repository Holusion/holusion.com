    <h2>Composition and functioning</h2>
    <p>
      This small holographic gadget is made of a suction pad and a plastic pyramid. If you place the pyramid on your smartphone, using the suction pad, you can visit <a href="http://pixel.holusion.com">pixel.holusion.com</a> to discover a playlist of 3D pictures that we have created for you. Then you just have to put your smartphone at eye level and look at the hologram floating in the pyramid.

    <h3>Pepper's ghost illusion</h3>
    <p>
      The hologram exists because of Pepper's ghost optical illusion. Your smartphone, under the pyramid, projects four pictures that are identical but independent upward, one on each face of the pyramid. It creates the illusion of a <b>3D picture that levitates in the pyramid</b>, thanks to the optical illusion. 
    </p>    
    <p>
      This pocket hologram can be transported everywhere and it is perfect to entertain your relatives or to present new stuff to your customers and colleagues, in an innovative way, simply using your smartphone.
