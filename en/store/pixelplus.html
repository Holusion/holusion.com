abstract: Holographic pyramid for smartphone in a nice structure
description: |
    The Pixel+ is a small holographic pyramid in a nice black structure. It is specially designed for 4" to 6" smartphones. With this holographic device, you can display small holograms, visible over 360Â° thanks to an optical illusion which gives the impression that a 3D picture is floating just above your smartphone.

      The Pixel+ is a normal Pixel that we have placed in a nice structure made of black plastic. If you put the structure on your smartphone and if you visit  <a href="http://pixel.holusion.com">pixel.holusion.com</a>  you will discover a playlist of 3D pictures that we have created for you. Then you just have to place your smartphone with the structure at eye level and look at the hologram floating in the pyramid.

      The hologram exists because of Pepper's ghost optical illusion. Your smartphone, under the Pixel+ structure, projects upward, four pictures that are identical but independent: one on each face of the pyramid. It creates the illusion of a 3D picture that levitates in the structure, thanks to the optical illusion.

      This pocket hologram can be transported everywhere and it is perfect to entertain your relatives or to present new stuff to your customers and colleagues, in an innovative way, simply using your smartphone.
