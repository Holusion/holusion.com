    <h2>Composition et functioning</h2>
    <p>
      You want your shop to be more attractive ? The holographic fan is a very good option to make your shop front more dynamic thanks to the holograms it displays. You can use the fan as a innovative medium to show 3D content so that you highlight your products. It is the opportunity for you to draw public's attention and encourage people to discover your different items.

      With its 60cm diameter, the fan is compact and you can set it up in a few seconds. It offers you a great mobility which is really pleasant if you want to insert an hologram in your shop window: the holographic display is perfectly visible, no matter the light in the room. You can also connect the fan in WIFI and choose the content you want to show. Doing so, you will be able to change the content displayed by the fan to suit your new products or offers.

      On each light bar of the fan, you can find LEDs strips that switch on as the holographic fan starts its high-speed rotation movement. Hence, it is the combination of the LEDs and the movement of the fan that creates the hologram, thanks to the retinal persistence. Furthermore, you can create larger holograms by using several synchronized holographic fans in order to create a "wal of fans" that will display a much larger hologram.
