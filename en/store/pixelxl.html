  <h2>Composition and functioning</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This holographic gadget is made of a plastic pyramid placed in a nice structure made of black plastic. If you place your tablet at the top of the structure with the screen looking down and if you visit <a href="http://pixel.holusion.com">pixel.holusion.com</a>, you will discover a playlist of 3D pictures that we have created for you. Then you just have to put the structure at eye level and look at the hologram floating in the pyramid.

    <h3>Pepper's ghost optical illusion</h3>
    <p>
      The hologram exists because of <b>the Pepper's ghost optical illusion</b>. Your tablet, at the top of the structure, projects four pictures that are identical but independent downward, one on each face of the pyramid. It creates the illusion of a 3D picture that levitates in the pyramid, thanks to the optical illusion.

      This structure can be transported everywhere and it is perfect to entertain your relatives or to present new stuff to your customers and colleagues, in an innovative way, simply using your tablet.
