      <h3>Tailor-made</h3>
      <p>
        This tailor-made flight case is made of <b>birch plywood </b> strengthened by <b>steel corner pieces</b> and <b>rounded corners</b> for higher protection. The case can be opened and closed with <b>butterfly clasps</b> that prevent it from accidental openings. 
      </p>
      <h3> Transport suggestions </h3>
      <p>
        When you put your Iris 32 in its flight case, <b>take care about the mobile elements </b> such as the power cable but <b>especially the glass pane</b>. You can place cardboard pieces between the pane and the metallic structure in order to prevent the pane from moving during the transport.
      </p>
      <P>
        Eight handles are placed all around the case surface  so it can be carried by several people. There are wheels under the case so that you can make it roll on flat surfaces.
