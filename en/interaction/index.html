        The Holomouseio device allows you to expose your libraries of 3D objects in holograms. A tablet is linked to the hologram and allows the visitor to choose the object presented. Information integrated into the tablet can complete the hologram, provide additional resources and illustrations.
      </p>           
      <p>Designed with research teams and museums, it is a <b>mediation and sharing tool</b> designed to <b>promote heritage and culture</b>. As part of digitisation work, Holomouseio makes it possible to present digitised documents and associated research or conservation work to the public.</p>

A table with a map of the city of Roubaix is completed by tactile metal inserts representing the city's notable industrial sites. A simple touch with the finger triggers audio-visual content in holograms, presenting the architecture of the site and explaining the city's industrial history.
