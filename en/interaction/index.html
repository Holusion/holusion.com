    <h3>Holomouseio, holographic museum</h3>
    <p>
      The Holomouseio device allows you to expose your libraries of 3D objects in holograms. A tablet is linked to the hologram and allows the visitor to choose the object presented. Information integrated into the tablet can complete the hologram, provide additional resources and illustrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed with research teams and museums, it is a mediation and sharing tool designed to promote heritage and culture. As part of digitisation work, Holomouseio makes it possible to present digitised documents and associated research or conservation work to the public.</p>

      <p>
        The <a href="/en/posts/2018-11-01-CaTisseFactory#video">Ca Tisse Factory</a> is a mobile interactive device based on the <b>Manufcature de Roubaix</b>. A table with a map of the city of Roubaix is completed by tactile metal inserts representing the city's notable industrial sites. A simple touch with the finger triggers audio-visual content in holograms, presenting the architecture of the site and explaining the city's industrial history.

      <h3>An holographic interview</h3>
      <p>
        Have our device perform an <b>interview in holograms</b>. Once the person has been filmed to be integrated into an Iris 75, visitors can ask them the questions previously recorded on a table. Thus, the hologram responds directly via the sound system to users. Interaction modules and language recognition can make the experience even more striking. </p>
        <p>
          Duplicate a person so that they <a href="/en/posts/2018-10-24-route_du_rhum#video">answer questions</a> from visitors.
